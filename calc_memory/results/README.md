All directories are named in the following convention:

ADSORBATE_SURFACE_FORCEFIELD_CRYSTAL_SIZE_EXTRA

Subdirectories are labeled based on the frequency of the adsorbate-surface interaction. 

The "EXTRA" specification can be either the size of the supercell used for calculating the dynamical matrix (e.g. "supercell=6x6") or specify that the results where calculated using perturbation theory ("pert")

See scripts in parent directory for more details on the structure and contents of each npz file.
